# Sample Workflow: User Authentication Feature

This example walks through a complete superspec workflow for a "User Authentication"
feature in a web application. It demonstrates each command, shows abbreviated outputs,
and illustrates superpowers integration with fallback behavior.

## Setup

Assume we have a fresh project with no `.specify/` directory yet.

---

## Phase 0: Create Constitution

```
User: /speckit.constitution TaskFlow
```

The agent interviews us about project principles, tech stack, and quality gates.
After the conversation, it creates:

**`.specify/memory/constitution.md`** (abbreviated):

```markdown
# TaskFlow Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Simplicity First
Start simple, YAGNI. Only add complexity when current design cannot solve the problem.

### II. Test-First
TDD mandatory for all business logic. RED-GREEN-REFACTOR strictly enforced.

### III. Security by Default
Authentication and authorization on every endpoint. Input validation at boundaries.

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Frontend | React + TypeScript | SPA |
| Backend | Express + TypeScript | REST API |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Primary storage |
| Testing | Vitest + Supertest | Unit + integration |

## Development Workflow
(superspec pipeline: constitution → specify → brainstorm → plan → tasks → execute → review)

## Quality Gates
- Unit tests: REQUIRED (80% coverage)
- TDD discipline: REQUIRED
- Code review: REQUIRED for API contracts and security
```

---

## Phase 1: Write Feature Spec

```
User: /speckit.specify "User authentication with email/password login, registration, and password reset"
```

The agent reads the constitution, interviews us about user stories, and creates:

**`specs/001-user-authentication/spec.md`** (abbreviated):

```markdown
# Feature Specification: User Authentication

**Feature Branch**: `001-user-authentication`
**Created**: 2026-04-22
**Status**: Draft

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Email Registration (Priority: P1)
As a new user, I want to register with my email and password so I can access the app.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. Given a valid email and password, When I submit registration, Then my account is created
2. Given an already-registered email, When I submit, Then I see "Email already in use"

### User Story 2 - Login (Priority: P1)
As a registered user, I want to log in with my email and password.

### User Story 3 - Password Reset (Priority: P2)
As a user who forgot my password, I want to reset it via email.

### Edge Cases
- What happens with extremely long passwords?
- How do we handle concurrent registration with the same email?

#### Brainstorm Prompts
(pre-populated prompts for edge case exploration)

## Open Questions
| # | Question | Status | Resolution |
|---|----------|--------|------------|
| Q1 | Maximum password length? | Open | — |

## Requirements
- FR-001: System MUST validate email format
- FR-002: System MUST hash passwords with bcrypt
- FR-003: System MUST issue JWT tokens on successful login
...
```

---

## Phase 2: Brainstorm Edge Cases

```
User: /speckit.superspec.brainstorm specs/001-user-authentication/spec.md
```

The agent checks for superpowers:

```
Checking for brainstorming skill...
✓ Found brainstorming at ~/.agents/skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md
  Using enhanced questioning protocol.
```

*(If not found, the agent would say: "Superpowers brainstorming not detected, using built-in questioning protocol.")*

The agent then asks questions one at a time:

```
Agent: Let's explore boundary conditions first.
       What should be the minimum and maximum password length?
       A) 8-64 characters (common standard)
       B) 8-128 characters (generous)
       C) 12-256 characters (strict minimum, very generous max)
       D) Other

User: A) 8-64 characters

Agent: Good. Now for error scenarios:
       What happens if a user tries to register and the database is temporarily unavailable?
       A) Show a generic "try again later" error
       B) Queue the registration and process when DB recovers
       C) Show specific error with retry button

User: A) Generic error with retry suggestion

Agent: Security question: Should we implement rate limiting on login attempts?
       A) Yes, lock after 5 failed attempts for 15 minutes
       B) Yes, progressive delay (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s...)
       C) Yes, CAPTCHA after 3 failed attempts
       D) No rate limiting needed

User: C) CAPTCHA after 3 attempts
```

After the session, the spec is updated:

```markdown
## Open Questions
| # | Question | Status | Resolution |
|---|----------|--------|------------|
| Q1 | Maximum password length? | Resolved | 8-64 characters |
| Q2 | DB unavailability handling? | Resolved | Generic error with retry |
| Q3 | Login rate limiting? | Resolved | CAPTCHA after 3 failed attempts |

## Brainstorm Log

### Session 2026-04-22
**Focus**: Full edge case exploration
**Key insights**:
- Added password length limits (8-64 chars) to FR-002
- Added rate limiting requirement: CAPTCHA after 3 failed login attempts (new FR-008)
- Clarified error handling for DB unavailability
- Identified need for email verification flow (deferred to Phase 2)
**Spec updates**: Added FR-008 (rate limiting), FR-009 (email verification), updated edge cases
```

---

## Phase 3: Create Implementation Plan

```
User: /speckit.plan
```

The agent reads the spec, researches the codebase, and creates:

**`specs/001-user-authentication/plan.md`** (abbreviated):

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: User Authentication

## Summary
Implement email/password authentication with registration, login, password reset,
and rate limiting. JWT-based session management.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x
**Primary Dependencies**: Express, bcrypt, jsonwebtoken, nodemailer
**Storage**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
**Testing**: Vitest + Supertest

## Constitution Check
| Principle | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Simplicity First | PASS | Standard auth patterns, no over-engineering |
| Test-First | PASS | TDD required for all auth logic |
| Security by Default | PASS | bcrypt, JWT, rate limiting, input validation |

## Execution Strategy

### TDD Requirements
- [x] Auth service (login, register, password reset logic)
- [x] JWT token generation and validation
- [x] Rate limiting logic

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
- User model + Auth middleware can be built in parallel
- Frontend auth pages can be built in parallel with backend API

### Human Checkpoints
1. After foundational setup — verify DB schema
2. After registration flow — verify end-to-end
3. After login flow — verify JWT handling
4. Before merge — security review
```

## Phase 5: Execute Implementation

```
User: /speckit.superspec.execute
```

The agent walks through tasks phase by phase:

```
Agent: Starting Phase 1: Setup.

[Implements T001: Prisma setup]
[Implements T002: Vitest config]

Phase 1 complete.
- T001 ✓ Prisma configured with PostgreSQL
- T002 ✓ Vitest + Supertest configured
All setup verified. Proceed to Phase 2?

User: Yes, proceed.

Agent: Starting Phase 2: Foundational.

T003 is marked [TDD]. Following RED-GREEN-REFACTOR:
  1. Writing test for User model... ✓
  2. Running test... FAIL (expected — model doesn't exist yet) ✓
  3. Implementing User model... ✓
  4. Running test... PASS ✓

T005 is marked [REVIEW]. API routes defined:
  POST /api/auth/register
  POST /api/auth/login
  POST /api/auth/reset-password
  POST /api/auth/reset-confirm
  POST /api/auth/refresh

Please review these API contracts before I proceed.

User: Looks good, proceed.

Agent: Phase 2 complete. Proceeding to Phase 3: Registration...
```

---

## Phase 6: Code Review

```
User: /speckit.superspec.review
```

```
Agent: Reviewing implementation against spec...

Checking for requesting-code-review skill...
✓ Found requesting-code-review at ~/.agents/skills/requesting-code-review/SKILL.md
  Using enhanced review protocol.

### Review Findings

**Spec Compliance**: 8/8 acceptance scenarios verified ✓

**Issues Found** (confidence >= 80):

1. **Critical** (confidence: 95): Rate limiting resets on server restart
   - File: src/services/rate-limiter.ts:42
   - The in-memory counter is lost on restart. Consider Redis-backed storage.
   - Recommendation: Add Redis adapter for rate limit state

2. **Important** (confidence: 85): Password reset tokens have no expiration
   - File: src/services/auth.service.ts:128
   - FR-010 requires tokens to expire after 1 hour, but no TTL is set.
   - Recommendation: Add `expiresAt` field to reset token generation

No other issues above confidence threshold.
```

## Summary

This walkthrough demonstrated:

1. **Constitution** → established Simplicity, Test-First, Security principles
2. **Specify** → created 3 user stories with acceptance scenarios
3. **Brainstorm** → discovered rate limiting, password length limits, error handling (with superpowers enhancement)
4. **Plan** → designed technical approach with constitution compliance check
5. **Tasks** → decomposed into 19 tasks with `[TDD]`, `[REVIEW]`, `[SUBAGENT]` markers
6. **Execute** → implemented with TDD discipline and human checkpoints
7. **Review** → found 2 issues with confidence-based scoring (with superpowers enhancement)

The spec file was the central artifact — brainstorming refined it, planning verified
compliance with it, tasks traced back to its user stories, and review verified
implementation against its acceptance scenarios.
