# Superpowers Bridge Reference

This document describes how superspec detects, invokes, and adapts obra/superpowers
skills. The SKILL.md references this document when a command needs superpowers
integration details.

## Detection Logic

Superspec checks for superpowers skills at these paths, in order of precedence:

1. **Project-local**: `$PROJECT_DIR/.agents/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`
2. **User-global**: `~/.agents/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`

A skill is considered **available** if its `SKILL.md` file exists at either path.
Project-local skills take precedence over user-global.

### Detection Steps

When a superspec command needs a superpowers skill:

1. Determine the skill name from the mapping table below
2. Check project-local path first (use Glob or Read tool)
3. If not found, check user-global path
4. If found: log "Found {skill-name} at {path}" and proceed with enhanced mode
5. If not found: log "Superpowers {skill-name} not detected, using built-in fallback"
   and proceed with fallback mode

## Skill Mapping

| Superspec Command | Superpowers Skill Name | Skill Directory |
|-------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| `/speckit.superspec.brainstorm` | `brainstorming` | `brainstorming/` |
| `/speckit.superspec.tasks` | `writing-plans` | `writing-plans/` |
| `/speckit.superspec.execute` | `executing-plans` | `executing-plans/` |
| `/speckit.superspec.execute` | `subagent-driven-development` | `subagent-driven-development/` |
| `/speckit.superspec.execute` | `test-driven-development` | `test-driven-development/` |
| `/speckit.superspec.review` | `requesting-code-review` | `requesting-code-review/` |

## Invocation Pattern

When a superpowers skill is detected, the agent follows this pattern:

### Step 1: Read the Skill

```
Read ~/.agents/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md
```

Parse the skill's instructions, process steps, and output expectations.

### Step 2: Adapt Context

Before following the skill's process, establish context adaptation rules:

- **Input context**: Pass relevant spec-kit artifacts as context
  - Constitution: `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
  - Spec: `specs/NNN/spec.md`
  - Plan: `specs/NNN/plan.md` (if exists)
  - Tasks: `specs/NNN/tasks.md` (if exists)

- **Output location**: All outputs go to the `.specify/` structure
  - Superpowers may default to `docs/superpowers/` — redirect to `.specify/`
  - Brainstorming insights → update spec.md (Edge Cases, Open Questions, Brainstorm Log)
  - Writing-plans output → merge into `specs/NNN/tasks.md`
  - Code review findings → report to user, optionally write to checklist file

- **Naming conventions**: Use spec-kit conventions
  - Feature numbering: NNN (001, 002, ...)
  - File naming: spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md (not design-doc.md, blueprint.md)

### Step 3: Follow the Skill's Process

Execute the superpowers skill's steps as documented in its SKILL.md, but with
the adapted context. The skill's methodology is the authority; only the
input/output locations are adapted.

### Step 4: Integrate Results

After the superpowers skill's process completes:
- Verify outputs are in the correct `.specify/` locations
- Update any cross-references (e.g., tasks.md referring to spec.md)
- Log what was done in the relevant tracking section (e.g., Brainstorm Log)

## Skill-Specific Adaptation Rules

### brainstorming → `/speckit.superspec.brainstorm`

**Process adaptation**:
- Follow the brainstorming skill's questioning protocol (one question at a time,
  Socratic method, challenge assumptions)
- Apply questions to the target spec document
- Record insights in the spec's "Open Questions" section and "Brainstorm Log"
- The skill may produce a "design document" — fold its insights back into the
  existing spec.md rather than creating a separate file

**Output mapping**:
| Superpowers Output | Superspec Destination |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Design document | Update spec.md Edge Cases + Open Questions |
| Clarified requirements | Update spec.md Functional Requirements |
| Resolved questions | Update spec.md Open Questions table (mark Resolved) |

### writing-plans → `/speckit.superspec.tasks`

**Process adaptation**:
- Follow the writing-plans skill's task decomposition methodology
- Structure the output using superspec's `tasks-template.md` format
- Apply execution markers (`[TDD]`, `[REVIEW]`, `[SUBAGENT]`, `[P]`) based on
  the plan's execution strategy section

**Output mapping**:
| Superpowers Output | Superspec Destination |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Implementation blueprint | `specs/NNN/tasks.md` |
| Task dependencies | Tasks Dependencies section |
| Parallel opportunities | Tasks marked with `[P]` and `[SUBAGENT]` |

### executing-plans → `/speckit.superspec.execute`

**Process adaptation**:
- Follow the executing-plans skill's batch processing protocol
- Respect checkpoint gates defined in tasks.md
- Apply human checkpoint protocol at every phase boundary
- Never auto-approve — always wait for user confirmation

**Combined with**:
- `subagent-driven-development`: For tasks marked `[SUBAGENT]`, follow this skill's
  dispatch protocol to delegate work to subagents
- `test-driven-development`: For tasks marked `[TDD]`, follow this skill's
  RED-GREEN-REFACTOR discipline

### requesting-code-review → `/speckit.superspec.review`

**Process adaptation**:
- Follow the requesting-code-review skill's pre-evaluation checklist
- Add superspec-specific review dimensions:
  - Spec compliance (acceptance scenarios from spec.md)
  - Constitution compliance (principles from constitution.md)
  - Brainstorm coverage (edge cases from brainstorming sessions)
- Report findings with confidence scores (0-100, threshold >= 80)

**Output mapping**:
| Superpowers Output | Superspec Destination |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Review findings | Reported to user |
| Checklist | Optional: `specs/NNN/checklist-review.md` |

## Graceful Degradation

Every superpowers integration has a built-in fallback. The skill NEVER hard-fails
when superpowers are not installed.

### Fallback Behavior Summary

| Superpowers Skill | Fallback | Where Defined |
|-------------------|----------|---------------|
| `brainstorming` | 5-category questioning protocol (boundary, error, scale, security, UX) | [workflow-guide.md](workflow-guide.md) Phase 2 |
| `writing-plans` | Direct template-based decomposition from plan | [workflow-guide.md](workflow-guide.md) Phase 4 |
| `executing-plans` | Sequential task walk with manual confirmation at checkpoints | [workflow-guide.md](workflow-guide.md) Phase 5 |
| `subagent-driven-development` | Sequential in-session implementation (no parallel dispatch) | [workflow-guide.md](workflow-guide.md) Phase 5 |
| `test-driven-development` | Inline TDD: write test → verify fail → implement → verify pass | [workflow-guide.md](workflow-guide.md) Phase 5 |
| `requesting-code-review` | Built-in review checklist (spec compliance, constitution, code quality) | [workflow-guide.md](workflow-guide.md) Phase 6 |

### Fallback Quality

The built-in fallbacks are designed to be **functional but lighter-weight** than
the full superpowers experience:

- **Brainstorming fallback**: Covers the same 5 categories but with simpler questioning
  patterns. Superpowers brainstorming adds Socratic method, assumption challenging,
  and more nuanced exploration.

- **Writing-plans fallback**: Produces a solid task breakdown from the plan template.
  Superpowers writing-plans adds more sophisticated dependency analysis and
  parallelization identification.

- **Execution fallback**: Walks tasks sequentially with manual checkpoints. Superpowers
  adds intelligent batching, parallel subagent dispatch, and automated checkpoint
  evaluation.

- **Review fallback**: Uses a static checklist approach. Superpowers adds multi-agent
  parallel review with confidence scoring and false-positive filtering.

## Troubleshooting

### Skills Not Detected

If superpowers skills are installed but not detected:

1. Verify the skill directory name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
2. Verify the SKILL.md file exists inside the skill directory
3. Check both paths: `.agents/skills/` (project) and `~/.agents/skills/` (global)
4. Verify file permissions allow reading

### Skill Process Conflicts

If the superpowers skill's process conflicts with superspec conventions:

1. Superspec output locations always take precedence (write to `.specify/`)
2. Superspec naming conventions always take precedence (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md)
3. The skill's methodology and questioning approach take precedence over fallback
4. When in doubt: follow the superpowers process, adapt only the outputs
