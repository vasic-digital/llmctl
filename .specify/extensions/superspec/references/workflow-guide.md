# Superspec Workflow Guide

This guide provides detailed phase-by-phase instructions for the superspec development
workflow. The SKILL.md file references this document for progressive disclosure —
the agent reads relevant sections as needed during command execution.

## Phase 0: Project Initialization

**Command**: `/speckit.constitution`
**Gate**: None — this is the entry point.
**Output**: `.specify/` directory structure + `memory/constitution.md`

### Steps

1. **Create directory structure**:
   ```
   .specify/
   ├── memory/
   ├── specs/
   └── templates/
   ```

2. **Copy templates** from the superspec skill's `templates/` directory into
   `.specify/templates/`. This gives the project its own copy of templates
   that can be customized.

3. **Interview the user** about:
   - Project name and purpose
   - Core principles (3-7 principles, each with a clear name and description)
   - Technology stack (layers, technologies, purposes)
   - Development workflow preferences (which quality gates to enforce)
   - Governance rules

4. **Generate constitution** using `constitution-template.md` as skeleton.
   Fill in all sections based on user responses. Ensure the "Development Workflow"
   and "Quality Gates" sections are populated.

5. **Write** to `.specify/memory/constitution.md`

### Verification

- File exists at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
- All template placeholders replaced with actual content
- At least 3 core principles defined
- Quality gates section has at least one requirement marked

---

## Phase 1: Specification

**Command**: `/speckit.specify`
**Gate**: Constitution must exist at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
**Output**: `specs/NNN-feature-name/spec.md`

### Steps

1. **Verify constitution** exists. If not, guide user to run `/speckit.constitution` first.

2. **Determine spec number**: Scan `specs/` for existing directories.
   Next number = highest existing + 1, zero-padded to 3 digits (001, 002, ...).

3. **Read constitution** to understand project constraints and principles.

4. **Interview the user** about:
   - Feature name and high-level description
   - User scenarios (who does what, why, expected outcomes)
   - Priority ranking of scenarios (P1, P2, P3)
   - Known requirements and constraints
   - Success criteria (measurable outcomes)
   - Assumptions

5. **Generate spec** using `spec-template.md` as skeleton.
   - Fill in user stories with Given/When/Then acceptance scenarios
   - Mark functional requirements with MUST/SHOULD/MAY
   - Flag unclear items as `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]`
   - Leave "Open Questions", "Brainstorm Log", and "Brainstorm Prompts" sections
     with initial prompts but no resolved content

6. **Write** to `specs/NNN-feature-name/spec.md`

7. **Suggest next step**: "Run `/speckit.superspec.brainstorm specs/NNN-feature-name/spec.md`
   to discover edge cases before planning."

### Verification

- File exists at expected path
- At least one user story with acceptance scenarios
- Priority assigned to each user story
- Functional requirements section populated
- Success criteria section populated

---

## Phase 2: Brainstorming

**Command**: `/speckit.superspec.brainstorm`
**Gate**: Target spec file must exist.
**Output**: Updated spec file (edge cases, open questions, brainstorm log).

### Superpowers Integration

If the `brainstorming` skill is detected (see [superpowers-bridge.md](superpowers-bridge.md)):
- Read its SKILL.md and follow its questioning protocol
- Adapt outputs to update the spec file instead of creating separate documents
- Follow its session structure (one question at a time, multiple choice when possible)

### Built-in Fallback Protocol

When superpowers brainstorming is not available, use this 5-category questioning protocol:

#### Category 1: Boundary Conditions
Ask about minimum/maximum values, empty states, and edge-of-range inputs.
- "What happens when [input] is empty?"
- "What's the maximum number of [items] the system should handle?"
- "What happens at exactly the boundary of [limit]?"

#### Category 2: Error Scenarios
Ask about failure modes, recovery, and degradation.
- "What happens when [external service] is unavailable?"
- "How should the system recover from [failure type]?"
- "What error message should the user see when [scenario]?"

#### Category 3: Scale & Performance
Ask about load, concurrency, and resource constraints.
- "What happens with [N]x expected traffic?"
- "Are there rate limits needed for [operation]?"
- "What's the acceptable response time for [action]?"

#### Category 4: Security & Privacy
Ask about attack vectors, data protection, and authorization.
- "Can [feature] be abused by [actor type]?"
- "What data needs to be encrypted or redacted?"
- "Who should NOT have access to [resource]?"

#### Category 5: User Experience
Ask about confusion points, accessibility, and unintended usage.
- "What if the user tries to [unintended action]?"
- "How does this work for users with [accessibility need]?"
- "What happens if the user navigates away mid-[process]?"

### Process

1. **Read the spec** and identify areas with thin coverage or placeholder edge cases.

2. **Ask ONE question at a time**. Wait for the user's answer before proceeding.
   Prefer multiple-choice format when possible for efficient exploration.

3. **After each answer**:
   - If it reveals a new requirement: add to spec's Functional Requirements
   - If it resolves an open question: update the Open Questions table
   - If it reveals an edge case: add to the Edge Cases section
   - If it changes an acceptance scenario: update the relevant user story

4. **Continue** through all 5 categories, skipping questions already covered by the spec.

5. **When the user says the spec is ready** (or all categories explored):
   - Add a dated entry to the "Brainstorm Log" section
   - Summarize: number of questions explored, insights discovered, spec updates made
   - Suggest: "Run `/speckit.plan` to create the implementation plan."

### Iteration

This phase can be run multiple times. Each session:
- Starts by reading previous brainstorm log entries to avoid repeating questions
- Focuses on the user-specified topic (if provided) or unexplored categories
- Appends a new entry to the brainstorm log

---

## Phase 3: Planning

**Command**: `/speckit.plan`
**Gate**: Spec file must exist. Brainstorm is recommended but not required.
**Output**: `specs/NNN-feature-name/plan.md`

### Steps

1. **Read inputs**: spec file, constitution, any previous plan for this feature.

2. **Constitution compliance check**: Verify the planned approach respects every
   principle. Document results in the "Constitution Check" table.

3. **Research the codebase**: Use Glob, Grep, and Read tools to determine:
   - Language/framework already in use
   - Existing patterns and conventions
   - Files that will need modification
   - Testing framework in use

4. **Design project structure**: Determine which files to create or modify.
   Document in the "Source Code" section of the plan.

5. **Determine execution strategy**:
   - Which components need TDD? (complex logic, critical paths)
   - Which work streams can run in parallel? (independent files)
   - Where are human checkpoints needed? (before integration, before merge)
   - What needs code review? (APIs, security, data models)

6. **Superpowers integration**: If `writing-plans` skill is detected, read it
   and use its blueprint process to enhance the execution strategy section.

7. **Generate plan** using `plan-template.md` as skeleton. Fill all sections.

8. **Write** to `specs/NNN-feature-name/plan.md`

### Verification

- Constitution check table completed — no unresolved violations
- Technical context filled (no remaining NEEDS CLARIFICATION without good reason)
- Project structure documented with real file paths
- Execution strategy populated with at least TDD and checkpoint decisions

---

## Phase 4: Task Decomposition

**Command**: `/speckit.superspec.tasks`
**Gate**: Plan must exist for the target feature.
**Output**: `specs/NNN-feature-name/tasks.md`

### Steps

1. **Read inputs**: plan, spec, constitution.

2. **Superpowers integration**: If `writing-plans` skill is detected, read it and
   follow its task decomposition process, but structure the output using
   `tasks-template.md` format.

3. **Decompose** the plan into phases:
   - Phase 1: Setup (project structure, dependencies)
   - Phase 2: Foundational (blocking prerequisites)
   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story, ordered by priority
   - Final phase: Polish and cross-cutting concerns

4. **Apply execution markers** from the plan's execution strategy:
   - `[TDD]` for components identified as needing test-first approach
   - `[REVIEW]` for components identified as needing review gates
   - `[SUBAGENT]` for independent work streams
   - `[P]` for tasks within the same phase that can run in parallel

5. **Define checkpoints** at each phase boundary.

6. **Document dependencies** and execution order.

7. **Write** to `specs/NNN-feature-name/tasks.md`

### Verification

- Every user story from the spec has corresponding tasks
- Tasks are traceable to user stories via `[US#]` labels
- Execution markers match the plan's execution strategy
- Phase dependencies are documented
- At least one checkpoint per phase transition

---

## Phase 5: Execution

**Command**: `/speckit.superspec.execute`
**Gate**: Tasks file must exist for the target feature.
**Output**: Code changes, updated task checkboxes.

### Steps

1. **Read inputs**: tasks, plan, spec, constitution.

2. **Superpowers detection**: Check for `executing-plans`,
   `subagent-driven-development`, and `test-driven-development` skills.

3. **Walk through tasks** phase by phase, respecting execution markers:

   **For `[TDD]` tasks**:
   - Write the test first
   - Run it — verify it FAILS
   - Implement the minimum code to pass
   - Run it — verify it PASSES
   - Refactor if needed
   - If TDD skill available: follow its full process

   **For `[SUBAGENT]` tasks**:
   - If subagent skill available: follow its dispatch protocol
   - Otherwise: implement sequentially
   - If marked `[P]` as well: use the Task tool for parallel execution

   **For `[REVIEW]` tasks**:
   - Complete the implementation
   - Present the changes to the user
   - Wait for explicit approval before continuing

   **For `[P]` tasks**:
   - Launch parallel tasks using the Task tool where possible
   - Ensure no dependency conflicts between parallel tasks

4. **At each checkpoint**:
   - Summarize completed work
   - Run applicable tests
   - Report results
   - Ask: "Phase [N] complete. Proceed to Phase [N+1]?"
   - Wait for explicit user approval

5. **Update task checkboxes** in `tasks.md` as each task completes.

### Human Checkpoint Protocol

The agent MUST:
- Never skip a phase checkpoint
- Present a clear summary of what was done
- Report test results if tests were run
- Wait for explicit "proceed" or "continue" from the user
- If the user requests changes, address them before proceeding

---

## Phase 6: Review

**Command**: `/speckit.superspec.review`
**Gate**: Implementation must exist (at least some tasks completed).
**Output**: Review findings reported to user.

### Steps

1. **Read inputs**: spec (acceptance scenarios), plan (constitution check),
   constitution (principles).

2. **Superpowers detection**: If `requesting-code-review` skill is available,
   follow its review protocol.

3. **Review dimensions** (built-in protocol):

   a. **Spec compliance**: For each acceptance scenario in the spec, verify it
      is implemented and can be demonstrated.

   b. **Edge case coverage**: For each edge case in the spec (including those
      from brainstorming), verify handling exists.

   c. **Constitution compliance**: For each principle, verify the implementation
      respects it.

   d. **Code quality**: Check for correctness, security, error handling, performance.

   e. **Test coverage**: Verify tests exist for critical paths.

4. **Report findings** with:
   - Confidence score (0-100, only report issues >= 80)
   - Severity (Critical / Important / Suggestion)
   - File path and line reference
   - Specific recommendation

5. **Group** by severity, highest first.

---

## Session Resumability

Superspec is designed to survive session interruptions. All state lives in plain-text
files under `.specify/memory/` (governance — `constitution.md`) and `specs/NNN-*/`
(per-feature — `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `progress.yml`). This section
documents how the agent detects and resumes work.

### Progress File: `progress.yml`

Each feature spec directory may contain a `progress.yml` file:

```yaml
feature: user-authentication
created: 2026-04-22
current_phase: execute
phases:
  constitution: { status: done, updated: 2026-04-22 }
  specify:      { status: done, updated: 2026-04-22 }
  brainstorm:   { status: done, updated: 2026-04-22, sessions: 2 }
  plan:         { status: done, updated: 2026-04-22 }
  tasks:        { status: done, updated: 2026-04-22 }
  execute:      { status: in_progress, updated: 2026-04-22, current_task: T012, completed_tasks: 11, total_tasks: 19 }
  review:       { status: pending }
```

### Resume Check Protocol

Every superspec command begins with:

1. **Scan `.specify/`** — does it exist? Are there spec directories?
2. **Read `superpowers.yml`** — which superpowers skills are available?
   If the file does not exist, run detection and create it.
3. **Read `progress.yml`** — what phase is each feature in?
4. **If no `progress.yml`**: Infer progress from file existence:
   - `constitution.md` → constitution done
   - `spec.md` → specify done
   - `spec.md` has Brainstorm Log entries → brainstorm was run at least once
   - `plan.md` → plan done
   - `tasks.md` → tasks done
   - `tasks.md` has `[x]` checkboxes → execute in progress
5. **Report** current state to the user (including superpowers status) before proceeding
6. **Resume** from the detected point (see phase-specific rules below)

### Phase-Specific Resume Rules

**Constitution** (`in_progress`):
- Re-read `constitution.md`
- Identify sections still containing template placeholders (`[PRINCIPLE_NAME]`, etc.)
- Ask user about remaining sections only

**Specify** (`in_progress`):
- Re-read `spec.md`
- Look for `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers and empty placeholder sections
- Continue the interview for unresolved items only

**Brainstorm** (`in_progress`):
- Re-read `spec.md` Brainstorm Log to see which sessions have been completed
- Re-read Open Questions table — count `Open` vs `Resolved`
- Skip categories already covered in previous sessions
- Resume from the first unexplored category or open question

**Plan** (`in_progress`):
- Re-read `plan.md`
- Look for `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` fields
- Fill in missing technical context; do not regenerate completed sections

**Tasks** (`in_progress`):
- Re-read `tasks.md`
- Verify all user stories from `spec.md` have corresponding tasks
- Add missing tasks without disrupting existing task numbering

**Execute** (`in_progress`):
- Re-read `tasks.md` — parse checkboxes
- Count `[x]` (completed) vs `[ ]` (remaining)
- Identify the **current phase** (first phase with unchecked tasks)
- Skip all completed tasks; resume from the first `[ ]` task in that phase
- If a phase checkpoint was not yet confirmed, re-present the checkpoint summary

**Review** (`in_progress`):
- Re-read any existing checklist files
- Continue from unchecked review items

### Writing `progress.yml`

The agent updates `progress.yml` at these moments:

| Event | Update |
|-------|--------|
| Command starts | Set phase to `in_progress`, update timestamp |
| Command completes successfully | Set phase to `done`, update timestamp |
| Brainstorm session ends | Increment `sessions` counter |
| Task checkbox toggled during execute | Update `completed_tasks` and `current_task` |
| User explicitly skips a phase | Set phase to `skipped` |

If `progress.yml` does not exist when a command runs, create it with all
prior phases inferred as `done` based on existing files.

### Superpowers Status File: `superpowers.yml`

A project-level file `.specify/superpowers.yml` persists the superpowers detection
results so they are **visible in the project docs** and **don't require re-detection
on every command**.

```yaml
# .specify/superpowers.yml
last_checked: 2026-04-22T14:30:00
skills:
  brainstorming:
    detected: true
    path: ~/.agents/skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md
  writing-plans:
    detected: true
    path: ~/.agents/skills/writing-plans/SKILL.md
  executing-plans:
    detected: false
  subagent-driven-development:
    detected: false
  test-driven-development:
    detected: true
    path: .agents/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md
  requesting-code-review:
    detected: false
```

**When to update `superpowers.yml`**:

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `/speckit.constitution` (first run) | Create the file with full detection results |
| `/speckit.superspec.status` | Re-run detection, update the file |
| Any command that needs a superpowers skill | If the skill was previously `detected: false`, re-check once (user may have installed it) |
| User manually edits the file | Respect the manual override — do not overwrite |

**Why persist this**:

1. **Visibility**: Anyone reading `.specify/` can see which superpowers the project uses
2. **Auditability**: The `last_checked` timestamp shows when detection last ran
3. **Speed**: No need to check the filesystem on every command invocation
4. **Override**: Users can manually set `detected: true/false` to force behavior

**Reading superpowers status during resume**:

When the resume check runs, it reads `superpowers.yml` instead of re-detecting.
This means a command like `/speckit.superspec.brainstorm` will use the cached detection
result to decide between enhanced mode (superpowers) and fallback mode (built-in).
If a skill was `detected: false` last time, the command does a single re-check
before falling back — in case the user installed it since the last session.
