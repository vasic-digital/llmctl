"""End-to-end: REAL tools/repack_fp8_passthrough.py output fed into the REAL
C loader (st_init/qt_from_disk in colibri.c) via a small C harness.

Neither test_fp8_load.c (hand-built wire-format C fixtures -- proves the C
loader's OWN logic, but the container bytes are hand-authored, not
tool-produced) nor test_fp8_repack.py (proves the Python tool's OUTPUT
shape, but never invokes the C loader at all) covers this round trip. This
test does, end to end:

  1. build a synthetic FP8 checkpoint with tools/glm_fp8_emit.py (the same
     fixture-generation helper test_fp8_repack.py uses -- not reimplemented
     here, imported directly);
  2. repack it with the REAL tools/repack_fp8_passthrough.py, invoked as a
     subprocess exactly as a user would run it from the command line (not
     imported and called as a library, so the CLI entry point is exercised
     too, not just the importable functions);
  3. compile tests/test_fp8_e2e_loader.c -- production flags mirroring the
     Makefile's own CFLAGS, asserted to produce zero warnings -- into a
     temp binary;
  4. run that binary against the REAL repacked output directory, asserting
     every selected tensor loads fmt=8 through the real qt_from_disk with
     finite dequantized values.

Three cases the round trip has to carry, all through the same real loader:

  * a RESIDENT tensor at the COLLISION shape (nblkO*nblkI==O). Its stamp is the
    only thing standing between fmt=8 and a silent int8-row misread, and this is
    the first test in the tree that proves the stamp does that job on a
    tool-produced container rather than a hand-authored one. Its proof-of-bite
    is a second run over the SAME container with the `colibri.fmt` key deleted
    from the header: the loader must then resolve the identical bytes to fmt=1.
  * a ROUTED EXPERT, unstamped by design (colibri.c's routed-expert load sites
    pass stamped_name=NULL), resolving to fmt=8 by byte arithmetic alone.
  * the container-level `colibri.container.formats` declaration, which no engine
    reads yet: an unknown `__metadata__` key must be IGNORED, not refused. That
    is invariant I-1's half of this PR -- an engine that does not know the key
    loads such a container exactly as it does today.

Hermetic: everything (checkpoint, repacked output, compiled harness binary)
lives under one TemporaryDirectory; nothing is left behind.
