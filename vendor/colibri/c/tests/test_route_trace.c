/* route_trace.h: the history format, and the property the whole design rests on —
 * that a reader written against the OLD format still recovers every record from a file
 * written by the new one.
 *
 * Case 7 is the important one. The header records are encoded as triples with a negative
 * layer precisely so that the pre-existing readers (telemetry.h's usage_load and
 * colibri.c's pin_load, both `while(fscanf(f,"%d %d %u",&l,&e,&c)==3)` guarded by l>=0)
 * parse them, discard them, and keep going. That contract is invisible in the code and
 * easy to break by "tidying" the header into a comment line or moving the engine hash
 * into the second field, so it is asserted here against a literal copy of that loop.
 *
 * This test includes route_trace.h (plus compat.h) and nothing else: no Model, no Cfg, no st.h.
 * That is the point of the header — any engine can use it — and compiling this file proves it. */
