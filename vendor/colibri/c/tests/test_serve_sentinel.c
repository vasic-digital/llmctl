/* test_serve_sentinel — the serve handshake must leave the wire bytes alone.
 *
 * `coli` matches the engine's sentinels byte-exactly (endswith on
 * "\x01\x01READY\x01\x01\n", a "^STAT ..." regex). If anything rewrites the
 * trailing LF, the gateway waits for a byte that never arrives and the session
 * hangs with no error at all -- which is #748: Kimi K3 on Windows loaded 93
 * layers in 42 minutes and then sat there forever.
 *
 * The cause is the CRT opening stdout in TEXT mode on Windows, where '\n' is
 * written as "\r\n". colibri.c has called _setmode(..., _O_BINARY) since #195;
 * inkling.c and kimi_k3.c were written without it, and nothing in the tree
 * noticed for months because no test ever looked at the bytes.
 *
 * This is that test. It writes the sentinel through a real FILE* to a real file
 * with coli_serve_binary_mode() applied, then reads the bytes back and asserts
 * there is no CR. On Linux and macOS it can only pass -- which is the point:
 * it is a Windows regression guard that costs nothing to carry elsewhere, and
 * CI now builds every engine on Windows (#736), so it runs where it matters.
