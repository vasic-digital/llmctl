"""Drafting changes the speed of a turn and nothing else.

Off by default since the first measurement on the real checkpoint, where it
accepted half its proposals and still cost 32% more wall clock; V41_DSPARK=1
turns it on, and this drives both paths.

DSpark proposes tokens and the main model verifies them in one forward. The whole
design rests on one property: what comes out has to be what would have come out
without it. This drives `coli serve` twice over the same prompt, once with drafts on
and once with V41_DSPARK=0, and compares the text.

The tiny fixture's draft head is random, so almost nothing it proposes is accepted --
which is the interesting half of the path, not the boring one: every round drafts,
verifies, rejects and rolls back, and if the rollback left the caches describing
positions that were never committed, the two runs would part company within a few
tokens.

Needs a V4.1 container with a DSpark head and a tokenizer. CI builds one with
tools/make_dsv41_tiny.py; set COLI_DSV41_FIXTURE to it.
