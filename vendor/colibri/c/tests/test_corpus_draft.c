/* Corpus draft source (COLI_DRAFT_CORPUS): the proposal lookup must be a pure
 * suffix match over the frozen ids, and it must never propose anything the
 * verifier would then have to reject for a structural reason.
 *
 * Why this test exists: corpus_draft() is the only NEW way tokens can enter
 * spec_decode's draft buffer. The verification path downstream is unchanged and
 * already lossless, but that guarantee only holds if the proposals themselves
 * are well-formed: within bounds, never past a span separator (-1), never
 * longer than the caller's cap, and empty when no suffix matches. A malformed
 * proposal would index draft[]/batch[] out of range in spec_decode long before
 * verification ever ran.
 *
 * The contract under test:
 *   1. longest-suffix wins: an n=8 match is preferred over an n=3 one
 *   2. most-recent-first: with two matches of equal length, the later corpus
 *      occurrence is proposed (recency = the freshest continuation)
 *   3. the -1 span separator terminates a proposal (spans never bleed together)
 *   4. g <= k always, and g == 0 when the context suffix is absent
 *   5. short contexts (< minn) and empty corpora propose nothing
 *
 * In-memory only (no scratch files, no model), so it builds clean on the
 * Windows MinGW CI job. */
