"""`coli doctor` must inspect the engine the model would actually run on (#783).

engine_path was hardcoded to the GLM binary, so doctor reported against colibri
whatever the model was. That misled in both directions: a user who had built
kimi_k3 was told "engine is not built", and anyone with a stale colibri lying
around would have been told the engine was ready for a model that never runs on
it. A diagnostic that reports on the wrong file is worse than no diagnostic.
