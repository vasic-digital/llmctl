# Qwen3.6-35B-A3B on colibri

`c/qwen36.c` runs [Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B)
(35B total / ~3B active, Apache 2.0) — a hybrid architecture: 25% Gated
Attention layers, 75% Gated DeltaNet (linear attention) layers, each followed
by a streamed MoE block (256 experts, top-8 + 1 shared). Dense weights stay
resident; routed experts stream from the container through an LRU + pinned
cache. Development notes live in `docs/qwen36-phase01.md` /
`qwen36-phase02.md`.

Architecture-identical checkpoints (same config geometry, e.g.
KAT-Coder-V2.5-Dev) run on this engine unchanged.

## Quickstart

Pre-converted containers (int4 experts, self-contained, ~20 GB):

```sh
# group-scaled int4 (gs64) — recommended, see "Which container" below
hf download Kreuzzelg/qwen36-35b-a3b-colibri-i4-gs64 --local-dir ~/Models/qwen36_i4_gs64

# per-row int4
hf download Kreuzzelg/qwen36-35b-a3b-colibri-i4 --local-dir ~/Models/qwen36_i4
```

or convert the original bf16 checkpoint yourself (~70 GB download):

```sh
python3 c/tools/convert_qwen36.py --repo Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B --out ~/Models/qwen36_i4_gs64 --gs 64
```

Build and chat:

```sh
make -C c qwen36
COLI_MODEL=~/Models/qwen36_i4_gs64 ./c/coli chat
```

`coli` reads the model's `config.json` and matches its `model_type` against the
family registry (`qwen3_5_moe` / `qwen3_5_moe_text` — an exact match, so other
Qwen architectures are not claimed by this engine), picks it, and drives it over the serve protocol — `coli web` and
`coli serve` (OpenAI-compatible API) work the same way.

Direct invocation without the gateway:

```sh
SNAP=~/Models/qwen36_i4_gs64 TOK=~/Models/qwen36_i4_gs64/tokenizer.json \
N_NEW=200 ./c/qwen36 256 4 prompt.txt
```

## CPU prefill batching

On AVX2/FMA CPUs, dense int8 projections process two prompt rows per weight
decode.  The same kernel is used by attention, the router, DeltaNet projections,
and the CPU shared expert.  `S=1` decode keeps the original four-register GEMV,
and non-AVX2 builds retain the established per-row implementation.  The shared
expert additionally batches gate/up/down calls across prompt rows with at most
32 MiB of temporary activations; the CUDA expert tier keeps its per-token shared
work so it can continue to overlap the in-flight GPU groups.

Both optimizations are bit-exact and on by default.  For controlled A/Bs,
`QWEN_DENSE_BATCH=0` restores per-row dense-int8 GEMVs and
`QWEN_SHARED_BATCH=0` restores per-row shared-expert calls.  A positive
`QWEN_SHARED_BATCH=N` limits each shared chunk to `N` rows.

Requirements: ~30 GB RAM for comfortable expert caching and NVMe storage for
the container. The default build is CPU-only; `make -C c qwen36 CUDA=1` adds
the optional CUDA VRAM expert tier documented in
[`qwen36-cuda-tier.md`](qwen36-cuda-tier.md).

## Which container?

The gs64 container carries one scale per 64-weight group instead of one per
row. On GLM, per-row int4 was the root cause of think-mode loops and
never-terminating generations (#455), and group scales fixed them in
controlled A/Bs — with `moe_intermediate_size=512`, Qwen's rows are short, so
per-row quantization error concentrates the same way. The gs64 container costs
~1.7 GB more on disk and a few percent on cold-start; warm decode speed is the
same or slightly better.

## `--ram` is not honoured by this engine

The engine reads no `RAM_GB`: `grep -c RAM_GB c/qwen36.c` returns 0, and passing
`--ram` changes nothing. Said here rather than left to be discovered, because a
flag that appears to work and does not is worse than one documented as
unsupported.

What sizes the expert cache instead depends on where the experts live. On the
CPU path they stream from the container on demand, through the LRU described at
the top of this page, and `--cap N` is the direct lever on how many slots per
layer that cache holds. On the CUDA expert tier (#713) the hot set is resident
in VRAM and `CUDA_EXPERT_GB` decides its size. Neither path consults the RAM
budget.

(Earlier revisions of this section said qwen36 does not stream experts at all,
which contradicted the description at the top of the page and was wrong for the
CPU path: `c/qwen36.c` reads experts on demand with `pread` plus
`posix_fadvise(DONTNEED)` and caches them LRU. Reported in #1444.)
